New ``worksteal`` scheduler, based on the idea of `work stealing <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_stealing>`_. It's similar to ``load`` scheduler, but it should handle tests with significantly differing duration better, and, at the same time, it should provide similar or better reuse of fixtures.
